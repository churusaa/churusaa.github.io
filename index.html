                I’m Millie, a mother of five and US Army veteran who loves to code and solve problems. Right now, I’m working through WeCanCodeIT to make the move from my high-level technical support role into a career in development because I picked up the coding bug
                when I was a child writing programs in BASIC, and it has stuck with me ever since. I’m happiest when I’m learning or solving a puzzle, and people like working with me because I work hard to be knowledgeable and helpful while also staying
                kind to people who ask me to share that knowledge.
